# liri-node-app

LIRI stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, which is a project created for an assignment which allows users to get the last 20 tweets of their account, or some one elses, as well as movie information from OMDB and musci information from Spotify. 

The project works with javascript, using node and downloadable node components that allow for API interactivity with user and further program dynamics. NPM programs installed which allow users to input command and get expected results are: spotify, request, ombd, and twitter.

## Built using:

Javascript, Node, Spotify API, Request, Twitter API, OMBD API, Console or Terminal for Mac users

## How to use:

Users have to initialize code using npm init -y command in Terminal once they are in the folder with liri.js file. Once initiated and JSON package created then the request, spotify, omdb, and twitter modules should be installed using the npm install command. All keys for the API's mentioned will be stored in a file which is not pushed to github, thus the user will need to get their own thwough these companies pages. 

Once all packages have been installed then the program can run using the following comands: "my-tweets" (retrieves 20 tweets), "spotify-this-song" + (song name) (searches for all info on a song), "movie-this" + (movie name) (searches for all info on a movie), "do-what-it-says" (which allows users to take in any of the previously mentioned commands).
